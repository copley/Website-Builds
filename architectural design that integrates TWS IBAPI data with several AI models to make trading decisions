Below is an architectural design that integrates TWS IBAPI data with several AI models to make trading decisions. In this architecture, you’ll use historical market data and calculated technical indicators from IBAPI, augment that with fundamental data (e.g., via Alpha Vantage), and then feed a unified prompt to multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT‑4.5‑preview, EleutherAI models via Hugging Face, Meta’s Llama‑2/3, Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek). The idea is to either choose one model’s recommendation or ensemble several responses for a more robust trade decision. Here's a step‐by‐step breakdown:

1. Data Collection Layer
IBAPI (TWS) Data:
Use IBAPI to pull historical market data (daily bars including date, open, high, low, close, volume). This data is the raw input for all your technical analysis.
Fundamental Data:
Retrieve fundamental metrics (such as P/E ratios, earnings growth, dividend yield, etc.) from providers like Alpha Vantage.
2. Data Processing & Indicator Calculation Layer
Preprocessing:
Clean and organize the IB historical data using Pandas, sorting by date and resetting indices.
Technical Indicators:
Calculate key technical metrics such as:
Moving Averages (5, 20, 50, 100, 200 days)
Price changes & percent changes
Average Volume
Momentum Indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastics)
Volatility measures (ATR, historic volatility)
Pivot Points and Fibonacci retracements
Standard deviation calculations and trend signals (e.g., your barchart opinion logic)
These indicators form the “facts” that you want your AI to consider.
3. Prompt Generation & Abstraction Layer
Unified Data Format:
Combine technical indicators and fundamental data into a standardized format (e.g., a JSON or Python dictionary) to be used in a prompt.
Prompt Template:
Create a prompt that summarizes the market scenario, including:
Technical data (e.g., current price, MAs, RSI, MACD, support/resistance levels)
Fundamental data (e.g., SPY’s P/E ratio, earnings growth)
A clear task for the AI: “Provide a trade recommendation (Buy/Hold/Sell), an estimated probability, and brief technical and fundamental justifications. Also, mention one macro risk.”
Model Abstraction:
Build an interface (or set of wrapper functions) so you can send this prompt to multiple AI providers:
OpenAI GPT‑4.5‑preview: Use the openai Python package.
EleutherAI Models: Send an HTTP POST request to the Hugging Face Inference API.
Meta’s Llama‑2/3: Either run a local server (using Docker or a partner API) or use an external endpoint.
Mistral 7B: Use its available API wrapper if provided.
DeepSeek: Call its API endpoint (which follows an OpenAI-compatible format).
Response Handling:
Collect and parse the responses so that each model returns a consistent format (trade recommendation, probability, justifications, risk factors). Optionally, you can use an ensemble approach (e.g., majority vote or averaging confidence levels) to decide on a final trade decision.
4. Decision-Making & Trade Execution Layer
Analysis Aggregation:
Combine the AI models’ outputs with your own computed signals (like your “Rogue Radar” logic) to form a final recommendation.
Risk Management:
Use technical indicators (e.g., ATR) to compute stop-loss and take-profit levels.
Execution:
Optionally, send trade orders via IBAPI if you want to automate execution.
5. Logging, Monitoring & User Interface
Logging & Monitoring:
Log all data inputs, computed indicators, AI responses, and trade decisions for auditing and performance tracking.
UI/Dashboard:
Present a dashboard (or terminal output) that displays the technical snapshot, AI recommendations, and trade parameters.
Configurability:
Allow users to configure which models to query, frequency of updates, and threshold parameters for technical indicators.
Data & Analysis Flow Summary
Collect Data:
IBAPI pulls historical market data and Alpha Vantage provides fundamentals.
Process Data:
Compute technical indicators (MAs, RSI, MACD, ATR, pivots, etc.) and compile an analysis DataFrame.
Generate Prompt:
Format a prompt with both technical and fundamental data.
Query AI Models:
Send the prompt to each AI model via respective API wrappers.
Aggregate & Analyze:
Parse responses, combine with your rule-based decision logic (e.g., “Rogue Radar”), and determine a trade decision.
Execute & Log:
Optionally execute trades via IBAPI and log all activities.

This modular design lets you extend or swap out AI models easily while keeping your core analysis (via IBAPI and technical indicator calculations) consistent. The goal is to harness advanced AI for high-level trade recommendations, while using solid, data-driven technical analysis as the foundation for profitable trading decisions.
