Node.js/Express stack with server-side rendering using EJS templates and a rich set of client-side tools. Here’s a breakdown:

Backend:
• Built on Node.js with an Express server.
• Uses EJS as the templating engine for server-rendered pages.

Frontend:
• Utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and UI components.
• Incorporates libraries like jQuery, Moment.js, and others for interactive functionality.

Additional Components:
• Integrates third-party services such as Mapbox (for mapping), Google Analytics/Tag Manager (for analytics), and NewRelic (for performance monitoring).
• Uses Varnish as a caching reverse proxy to enhance performance.

Explanation
Root Files:

package.json lists the Node.js dependencies and scripts.

server.js is where the Express server is configured and started.

Configuration (config/):

Contains settings for external services such as NewRelic for performance monitoring and a Varnish configuration file to handle caching.

Public Directory (public/):

Holds all static files.

The css/ directory includes both third-party (Bootstrap) and custom CSS.

The js/ directory stores libraries (jQuery, Moment.js, etc.) along with your custom scripts.

fonts/ and images/ are for additional assets like fonts (via the Google Font API) and images (like logos).

Views (views/):

Uses EJS for templating.

The layouts/ folder holds a master layout (main.ejs) that wraps individual page content.

partials/ are reusable components such as header and footer, which can include common integrations like Google Tag Manager or Analytics.

Routes (routes/):

This folder contains files defining the site’s endpoints (like the home page or APIs).

This structure provides a clean separation of concerns between server code, static assets, configuration, and view templates, making the application scalable and maintainable.

Below is an example of common commands you might use to install dependencies, build, and run a Node.js/Express app like the one outlined:

Install Dependencies:
This command reads the package.json file and installs all required modules.

npm install
Build Assets (if applicable):
If your app uses a build tool (like Webpack, Gulp, or another bundler) to compile assets (e.g., minifying CSS/JS), you might have a build script defined in your package.json. For example:

npm run build
Note: Many Express apps with EJS don't require a build step for server-side code, but you might use one for front-end assets.

Run the Application:
To start your Express server, you can run:
npm start
This typically runs something like node server.js as defined in your package.json scripts.
Alternatively, during development, you might use a tool like nodemon to auto-restart the server on file changes:

nodemon server.js
Additional Commands (Optional):
If your project includes tests or other scripts, you might see commands like:

bash
Copy
npm test      # To run tests
npm run dev   # Possibly a custom command for development mode
The exact commands depend on the scripts defined in your package.json, but the above provide a common workflow for developing and deploying an app structured as described.

Reasoned about project startup workflow for a couple of seconds
You’d typically run those commands from the project’s root directory—the folder that contains the package.json file and other key files like server.js. For example, if your project is in a folder called "my-metlink-app", you’d open a terminal, change to that directory:

cd path/to/my-metlink-app
Once there, you can run commands like npm install, npm run build, and npm start so that Node.js can correctly locate your configuration and code files.
